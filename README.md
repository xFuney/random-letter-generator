# Random Letter Generator

A simple program that takes a random letter and presents it onto the screen. This was made for a "Social Event", as to mitigate the reliance on a webpage.

# Build Instructions
This was programmed using Visual Studio 2019, this should be as easy as:
```
git clone https://github.com/xFuney/random-letter-generator.git
```
Then open the Project up in VS2019 - settings should be set for proper building automatically, raise an issue if it isn't.

Please don't report issues if they're to do with your environment - "exotic" environments (non-VS2019) shouldn't have issues raised unless they are proven to affect non-exotic builds.
# Run Instructions
You'll find releases [here](https://github.com/xFuney/random-letter-generator/releases).

After building, you'll find your files in the Debug/ folder of your workspace. The executable file is the only one you need - don't build a proper Release executable, as it does some dodgy downloading stuff that is just too uncomfortable. If you want to do it, do it but just remember that it's probably not your best solution.
